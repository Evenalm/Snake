# Snake
Project involving porting C++ code to Python for UI.

Written and tested using Visual studio 2019 w/C++ compiler and python 3.7(32 bit) environment.

Run application snake.exe to start.
A console window can also be used to play, start any of the three batch scripts 
in the console subfolder. Already having a cmd window open helps, as this will not start 
the python GUI.

External libraries used: pybind 11 for porting and (python)arcade for visuals / GUI.
